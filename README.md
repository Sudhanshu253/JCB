# JCB Excavator Prototype

A mechanical engineering project focused on the design and fabrication of an excavator prototype using mechanical linkages in place of conventional hydraulic systems. Completed as part of the TA211 course under Prof. Kallol Mondal at IIT Kanpur.

## Project Highlights

- Designed and fabricated a working **excavator prototype** using **wired control and mechanical linkages**, replacing typical hydraulic actuation mechanisms.
- Developed detailed **2D and 3D component drawings**, including **isometric and orthographic views**, aligned with engineering drafting standards.
- Applied fabrication techniques such as **cutting, welding, drilling, and grinding** to manufacture and assemble parts using **mild steel** and **aluminum sheets**.
- Focused on mechanical accuracy, functional articulation, and structural stability in the overall design.

## Tools & Techniques

- Engineering drawing (manual & CAD-based)
- Mechanical fabrication and workshop tools
- Sheet metal manufacturing (mild steel, aluminum)
- Mechanical linkage systems and wired control

## Purpose

This project aimed to explore the **practical application of mechanical design principles**, emphasizing control through linkages and hands-on fabrication over fluid-based systems. It highlights an alternative approach to motion transmission in construction equipment.
